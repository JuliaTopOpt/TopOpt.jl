`TopOpt` is a topology optimization package written in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). To learn more and see some examples, visit the [documentation](https://juliatopopt.github.io/TopOpt.jl/stable). Numerous examples can also be found in the `test/examples` and `test/wcsmo14` directories.

## Installation

To install `TopOpt.jl`, run:

```julia
using Pkg
pkg"add TopOpt"
```

To additionally load the visualization submodule of `TopOpt`, you will need to install `Makie.jl` using:

```julia
pkg"add Makie"
```

To load the package, use:

```julia
using TopOpt
```

and to optionally load the visualization sub-module as part of `TopOpt`, use:

```julia
using TopOpt, Makie
```
